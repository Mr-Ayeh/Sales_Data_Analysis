# Sales_Data_Analysis
The goal of this Project is to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

## Overview of Project

In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights such as exploring sales trends over time, identifying the best-selling products, calculating revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and also created a visualizations to present my findings. 
This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Tools Used: 
1. Excel
2. Power BI

In this project I ;
1. Explored sales trends month
2. Identified the top 5 selling products by count
3. Identified the top 5 best-selling products
4. Identified the weekly sales distribution by weekday
5. Identified the top 5 cities with the highest sales
6. Calculated revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins

## STEPS FOLLOWED:

### DATA IMPORT: 

* First I Gathered data from Meriskill and imported it into Power BI for data transformation

### DATA TRANSFORMATION: 
Used Excel to clean and transform the data

### DATA LOADING AND MODELLING: 
I imported the transformed data into Power BI for analysis and created the necessary relationships between the tables.

+ Total Sales: $34,492.04
+ Total Quantity Ordered: 209.08k
+ Profit Margin: 58.83% increase
+ Top Product by Quantity Ordered: AAA batteries (4-pack)
+ Top Product by Sales Count:  MacBook Pro Laptop
+ The month with the highest sales: December

## Recommendation;
Since the month with the highest sales is December due to the festive occasion, more products should be on the market to bring the highest return possible.
The price of the product in areas that generate less revenue should be reduced to increase the popularity of the store and create an increase in sales in January, February, August, and September to increase ** ROI ** for the year.

# Sales_Data_Analysis
The goal of this Project is to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

## Overview of Project

In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights such as exploring sales trends over time, identifying the best-selling products, calculating revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and also created a visualizations to present my findings. 
This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
